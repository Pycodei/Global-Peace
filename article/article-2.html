        <h1>Peace & Justice</h1>
        <p>Promoting peace and justice, 
            as outlined in Sustainable Development Goal 16, 
            aims to create peaceful and inclusive societies, 
            ensure access to justice for all, and build effective,
            accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels.
            Goal 16 is about promoting peaceful and inclusive societies,
            providing access to justice for all and building effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.
            People everywhere should be free of fear from all forms of violence and feel safe.
        </p>

        <p>Peace is a state of harmony and the absence of conflict, violence, or war.
            It involves mutual understanding, cooperation, and respect among individuals,
            communities, and nations.
        </p>
    
    <p>Peace can be categorized into:</p>

        <ul>

            <li>Positive Peace – The presence of justice, equality, and 
                sustainable social structures that prevent conflict.</li>
            <li>Negative Peace – The absence of direct violence or war.
                Justice refers to fairness, equity, and the proper administration 
            of laws to ensure that all individuals are treated equally.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>It involves:</p>

        <ul>

            <li>Social Justice – Equal rights and opportunities for all, regardless of background.</li>

            <li>Criminal Justice – Fair legal processes and accountability for wrongdoing.</li>

            <li>Economic Justice – Fair distribution of wealth and resources.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Simple Ways to Promote Peace in the World and Work Toward Justice</h2>
        
        <p>As the world faces food shortages,
            social and racial tensions and a pandemic,
            many individuals, families and communities are searching for tangible steps they can take 
            to help establish peace and justice in the world.Here are five practical ways 
            to begin working toward peace and justice in the world—starting within your own community:
        </p> 

        <h3>Use your voice</h3>
        
        <p>Sometimes all it takes to begin building a more peaceful and inclusive society is for one person to take a stand for what is right.
            You can start by speaking up when you see someone being mistreated, advocating for the dignity of others in your community or joining a local organization fighting for justice.
            By speaking out when you see injustices, you are helping raise awareness and creating greater opportunities for those who are suffering.
        </p> 

        <h3>Learn the signs of human trafficking</h3>
        
        <p>More than 600,000 men, women and children are trafficked across international borders each year.
            Often, victims encounter other people in public places while being transported. 
            These encounters provide opportunities for rescue – and simply learning what signs
            to look for can dramatically increase your ability to help and save a life.
        </p>

        <h3>Volunteer at a local food bank or soup kitchen</h3>

        <p>With the current state of the world,
            there are more people than ever who lack access to food and other basic necessities.
            Find your local food bank or soup kitchen and volunteer to help make,
            package or distribute food to those in need.
            You can also ask your parish if they have a food pantry that helps those in need.
            Call the parish office and ask what items are low in stock or what their greatest needs are at the moment.
        </p>
        
        <br>

        <p>Support the work of missionaries serving vulnerable populations.
            Many injustices around the world stem from poverty and inequality that leave certain populations more vulnerable than others.
            Organizations such as Divine Word Missionaries serve within these communities to advance the cause of the marginalized and defenseless.
            They spread peace by bringing the healing and hope of the Gospel to those in need.
        </p>

        <h3>Pray for peace and justice</h3>

        <p>Prayer is the most powerful tool we have.
            It can change the hearts of people all over the world and bring them to a place of receptivity to the truth of their own and other's dignity. 
            It allows God to enter our heart and fill us with his love so that we can focus on doing his will.
            By joining with the voices of millions around the world, prayer connects us in the most sincere form of love of neighbor.
        </p>
        
        <br>

        <p>The caliber of injustices committed around the world is so great often making it feel impossible to pray for every need.
            However, when you join Divine Word Missionaries in praying the Global Church Novena, you lift up ALL of the Church's intentions in nine days of prayer. 
            This powerful form of intercession allows the graces of your prayers to be dispersed across the world.
